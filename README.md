Truchas
==============================================================================
Truchas is open source software developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) and collaborators for physics-based modeling and simulation of
manufacturing processes. Its core capabilities are primarily geared toward
metal casting, with developing capabilities for metal additive manufacturing.
It is, however, a general multi-physics computational tool that is useful for
a wider range of applications.

The Truchas software repository is located at https://gitlab.com/truchas/truchas
